<h1>Vocal Isolation Project</h1>
<p>This repo contains my work on extracting vocals from mixed audio</p>
<p> It can be broken down into three tasks of:</p>
<li><b>Data Collection and Data Cleaning</b></li>
<li><b>Voice Activation Detection</b></li>
<li><b>Voice Extraction</b></li>
<p>I collected Acapella data and instrumental data from Youtube with automated scripts, labeled where the signals were present and mixed them. With this dataset I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to classify where vocals in the track were present and not preset.</p>
